# Login Page

This repository contains files for a basic login page implemented in HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript.

## Description

The login page provides a simple interface for users to input their credentials (username and password) to access a system or application.

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure and form elements for the login page.
- `style.css`: CSS file responsible for styling the login page elements.
- `script.js` : JavaScript file for client-side interactions and enhancements.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the login page.
3. Enter a valid username and password (if required) to simulate login functionality.

## Customization

- To modify the appearance of the login page, edit the styles in `style.css`.
- For any client-side interactions or enhancements, modify or add functionality in `script.js`.

## Important Notes

- This login page serves as a basic template and might not include advanced security measures or server-side validation.
- For a production environment, always implement proper authentication and security measures on the server-side.
- This code does not handle user authentication securely. Avoid using it in a production environment without appropriate security implementations.
